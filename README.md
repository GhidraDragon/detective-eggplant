First of all, if 2017 Tufts through now was "caused by amphetamine" they wouldn't even be able to prosecute me, if law existed fairly, for some things??? Such as the A&B charge.

So if my social security card was stolen (passport, social security card, federal MA driver's license, and whatever) were in my passport case, why is my Mom on the phone about applying for SSI?? if the card was stolen first!

I mean if the fan speed doesn't correlate with the controller controlling it, it's probably got Stuxnet installed

There's wayyy too many of these, possibly still in existence?? but here's YouTube
